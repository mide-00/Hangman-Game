# Hangman-Game

This project is python code version of the Hangman game.

It starts out with 6 lives so users can get a few tries at it, and each try picks a different word at random.

I have included a few additionally files called hangman_art.py and hangman_words.py to add a better user experience to the game over all.

This was a fun project for me to practice my python from scratch again. 

Look out for possible updates, but most importantly..... have fun with it!!! ðŸ˜„
